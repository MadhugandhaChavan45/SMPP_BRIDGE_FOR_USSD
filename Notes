SMPP :

-SMPP or Short Message Peer to Peer protocol is an open standard protocol that uses TCP/IP protocol for the transport of protocol messages. Earlier to SMPP, ss7 was the standard protocol for messaging over the GSM network. 

-The SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol is an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communications interface for the transfer of short message data between External Short Message Entities (ESME), Routing Entities (RE) and Message Centres (MC). It is a means by which applications can send and receive SMS messages to and from mobile devices. Applications do this using an SMPP connection to a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), [SMS gateway](https://smpp.org/sms-gateway.html), SMPP gateway or hub

- The SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol) provides you with an environment to send and receive short messages.
- U*[SSD](http://www.cspsprotocol.com/ussd/)* and SMS both can use SMPP. A messaging application can be developed using SMPP.
- SMPP is an open standard. Two peers can develop applications independently.
